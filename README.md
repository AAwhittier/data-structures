# Data Structures Tutorial
Welcome to my data structures tutorial. This tutorial will start by
covering Big-O notation, a key skill to be able to apply the topics
we will learn about here. We will then learn about both Queues and Linked
Lists. From there we will cover recursion in order to be able to learn about
our final topic, Trees.

## **Start here:**
1. [Big O Notation](BIGO/big-o.md)
2. [Queues](QUEUE/queue.md)
3. [Linked Lists](LINKEDLIST/llist.md)
4. [Recursion](RECURSION/recursion.md)
5. [Trees](TREES/trees.md)
